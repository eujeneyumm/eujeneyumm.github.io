My name is Eujene Yum, a graduating student in the [M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy program at the University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). I am interested in using machine learning models to solve interesting problems and creating pipelines for efficient data storage. 

At the University of Chicago I have taken the following coursework:
* **Fundamental Computing:** CS 121, CS 122
* **Data Storage:** Databases, Cloud Computing
* **ML:** Machine Learning for Public Policy, Math for Machine Learning, Advanced ML (NLP)
* **Statistics:** Advanced Statistics, Program Evalualtion, Time Series Analysis
* **Policy:** Crime Prevention

I also serve as the teaching assistant for R programming, Data & Programming II for Public Policy and Databases. 

Most recently, I worked as a data science intern for the Bureau of Labor Statistcs, where I built an automated high frequency dashboard using streamlit and pandas (python) of monthly productivity measures in 70+ retail industries utilizing Census and BLSâ€™s API. ([link to project presentation](https://github.com/codingitforward/cdf2022/blob/main/Eujene_Yum.pdf))

Previous to graduate schooling, I earned a B.A. in Economics at Tufts University (Summa Cum Laude) and worked as a quantitative data analyst at Liberty Mutual, where I supported the Claims department with data analysis and decision making particularly in the realm of claims adjustor segmentation. One of the biggest projects I led was to establish an infrastructure for a centralized reporting suite via Power BI with a team of 12 analysts creaing 30+ fully autmated reports, which supported 80+ managers in their ability to monitor the health of the organization.
