Welcome to my website! My name is Eujene Yum, a graduating student in the [M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy program at the University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). I'm hoping to work in the realm of implementing machine learning models with big data and creating pipelines for efficient data storage.
